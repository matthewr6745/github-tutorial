## Repository Setup
First you write "git init", nexxt you do git add "README.md"(or whatever you want to add is called.) NEXT you do git commit -m "whatever you want." Finally you "git push" to Github BUT FIRST you
use mkdir to make a file, then cd (folder name) into it. make your file and cd into it.
## Workflow & Commands
To save you would go to file and press save, or press command s(This is usually when you are done or want to save)
Git add makes the site know what you want to push(1st)
Git commit makes the file be know as something when it is pushed(2nd)
Git push places the file inside of github(3rd)
